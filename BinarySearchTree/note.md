# Binary Search Tree

Some given rules are as follows:

1. There are subtrees within a tree
2. Given the pivot at the highest or first level of the tree. The elements of the subtree that is located within the left of the pivot should be lesser than the pivot(root)
   and the right subtree is larger than the pivot.

Point to be taken is that a binary tree is different from binary search tree. The rules of the binary tree is that it mostly has 2 childs like it's name indicates.


Here we will cover operations such as traverse, search , inverse a

Traversing the tree is performed  is performed using 4 different ways. 3 steps is always needed and that is visit, move left and move right.

# Preorder traversal

'''
function preorder:
    visit
    traverse left
    traverse right
'''
 

# Inorder traversal

'''
function preorder:
    
    traverse left
    visit
    traverse right
'''

# Postorder traversal

'''
function postorder:
    
    traverse left
    traverse right
    visit
