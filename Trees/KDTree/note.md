# Kd Trees


Here kd trees is an extension of the 2d keys ordered symbol table. 2d meaning we have 2 values such as x and y in a 2d space. 

Operations of KD trees are:

1. Insert a 2d key
2. Delete a 2d key
3. Search a 2d key
4. Performing range search, that is to find a keys within a 2d range(rectangle)
5. Performing range count similar to the number of keys

Geometric view in this case are that the keys lie in a point and we need to find the points or the number of points in a given rectangle
